# S1 Coursework
__Author: Prithvi Singh__


This project involves a Python notebook and accompanying project report for the S1 Statistical Methods module in the MPhill in data intensive science. 

The notebook requires the following libraries to function:
1. numpy
2. matplotlib
3. scipy
4. numba_stats
5. iminuit
6. sweights
7. warnings 
8. timeit

Please make sure all these modules are installed on your workspace before trying to run the notebook. The code is reproducible if all cells are run sequentially.


## Declaration of AI use

LLMs were used to access documentation for different packages used in the code and to plot figures, they were also used to brainstorm methods to fix bugs. However, no code was explicitly copied and pasted from the output of an AI model and all the code in this notebook has been written by hand.
