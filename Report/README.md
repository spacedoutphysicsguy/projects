# C1 Final submission

This folder contains both the dual_autodiff package and its cythonized counterpart dual_autodiff_x.

To run the accompanying notebook one must install wheels for both the cythonized and regular python versions of this package, which are provided in this folder, and also install matplotlib seperately using:
pip install matplotlib

matplotlib has not been mentioned as a dependancy for this package because it is not required for any purpose other than running the accompanying notebook.


### AI use disclaimer 
AI has been incorporated to write the code and documentation for this project, especially for the task of Cythonizing and building wheels. However, its implementation has been checked and absorbed and it has been used as a tool for learning.
